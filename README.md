# Dotfiles - my Unix configuration

This current configuration is set to target FreeBSD. I may or may not add branches in the future for Arch Linux/OpenBSD.

That being said, in order to make this configuration usable, one mus install in addition to sway & zsh; waybar, fuzzel, konsole, swaylock-effects, ohmyzsh, and finally two font packages - noto-basic & noto-emoji. Be sure to follow the correct instructions to enable the graphics drivers for your platform, add your user to the video group, and enable seatd!!
