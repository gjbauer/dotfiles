# Dotfiles - my Unix configuration

This branch is set to target OpenBSD. The 'main' branch is set to target FreeBSD. I may or may not add branches in the future for Arch Linux.

That being said, in order to make this configuration usable, one must install in addition to sway & zsh; dmenu, konsole, swaylock, and finally a font package - noto-fonts. After setting the user shell to ZSH, run the ZSH setup script. Be sure to install the firmware for your graphical environment using `fw_update` and enable seatd!!
